Years ago I had a weblog hosted by Eric on his server which was subsequently closed down.
I have saved all the text and sample code from these weblogs.
The code mostly dealt nwith beautifying VFP projects using various methods.
All files are in ZIPM format and may be downloaded and used by anyone provided they do not claim the code or the methods used, as their own.
