Years ago I had a weblog hosted by Eric on his server which was subsequently closed down.
I have saved all the text and sample code from these weblogs.
The code mostly dealt with beautifying VFP projects using various methods and using the GDI+ classes.
All files are in ZIP format and may be downloaded and used by anyone provided they do not claim the code or the methods used, as their own.
